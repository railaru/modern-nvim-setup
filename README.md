## Cheat sheet

Quick reminder for nvim/vim commands.

### Commands

- `:w` to save
- `gg` go to the top of the file instantly
- `ctrl + ]` to go back and forth between the implementation and definition.
- `shift + :`  go to enter a command mode
- `s` to search for text within the same file
- `~/.config/nvim`

You can combine commands. For example:
- `d + 3 + j` will delete 3 lines below.
- `d + w` will delete a word.

ðŸ’¡ Deleting also works as copying. You can delete a line and then type p to paste it somewhere else.

### Insert mode
- `i` enable insert mode
- `a` enable insert mode one letter forward.
- `esc` or `ctrl + c` or `ctrl + [` leave insert mode

### Visual mode:
- `v` enable visual mode
- `y` "yank" copy selected region. You can also type yy to automatically select the line for yanking. This is a similar action as dragging a selected region with mouse.
- `p` paste the selected region
- `shift + v`, "visual line mode", copy the region with the lines, not just the text.

ðŸ’¡ You can copy a region, select a new region and it will delete and add the copied region to the selection.

ðŸ’¡ Yanking also works with numbers, for example `y + 5 + j` (copy 5 lines to bottom)
